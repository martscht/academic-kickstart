<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>After learning the basics of LIFOS and <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> and selecting the correct template, it’s now time for you to create your first project.</p>
<div id="creating-your-own-project" class="section level4">
<h4>Creating your own project</h4>
<p>As a reminder, the page (before you create a project) looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_projectsstartsite.png" /></p>
<p>Here you can view all possible projects in your group. As you have already learned, <em>Your Projects</em> shows all the projects you are involved in. If you have never created a project on the server before, there will be nothing here. But you can browse projects in your group under <em>All</em>.</p>
<p>To create a project in your group, click on <strong>New Project</strong> in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_newproject.png" /></p>
<div id="options-to-select" class="section level5">
<h5>Options to select</h5>
<p>After that, you will be shown a page with four options: Create blank project, Create from template, import project, and Run CI/CD for external repository. As described in the other tutorials, we have prepared templates for you so that you don’t have to start the process completely from scratch.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_newprojectoptions.png" /></p>
<p>Therefore, you select the option <em>Create from template</em>. To access the templates relevant to you, you need to click on <strong>Instance</strong> in the following column. The <em>Built-in</em> templates are global templates available to any <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> user on any instance worldwide. You can explore these another time or with a test project. But the templates you find under <strong>Instance</strong> are most important for you.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_newprojectinstance2.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assigning-your-project-to-your-group" class="section level4">
<h4>Assigning your project to your group</h4>
<p>Now you need to select your group under the <em>Pick a group or namespace</em> section in the <em>Project URL</em> field.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_pickgroup.png" />
This step is very important as the project should be assigned to the correct department! If you are not yet a member of your department’s group, please refer back to the <a href="/post/lifos-orientierung">Orientation Tutorial</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="datenschutz" class="section level3">
<h3>Datenschutz</h3>
<!-- soll ich das (Maria) auch machen? Wenn  ja wo finde ich die nötigen Informationen dazu, was man hochladen darf und was nicht? -->
<!-- Nein - Julia wird dazu was schreiben und sich auch noch entscheiden, in welches Tutorial es aufgenommen wird; könnte auch bei der Beschreibung der Templates passieren -->
<div id="visibility-levels" class="section level5">
<h5>Visibility-Levels</h5>
<p>After you have selected the template that best suits your project, you need to give it a name and, in theory, you have the option to adjust the <em>visibility level</em>. The latter determines who can see the project and all its associated files. There are three options, which are explained below. However, you should always choose the <em>internal</em> option as the default. If you do not want your data to be available to the instance, the data folder must remain empty. More information can be found here.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Private</strong>
</summary>
<p>If you select this option, only members of the group to which the project is assigned can access it. You should choose this option only for a test project for practicing, otherwise always choose <em>internal</em>.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Internal</strong>
</summary>
<p>You should always choose this option.</p>
<p>By selecting this option, anyone with access to <strong>LIFOS</strong> can see your project. For example, your project could be visible to others under <em>Explore Projects</em>. If your data allows for this setting, it is definitely the preferred approach, as open science aims to make as much as possible accessible. Within the instance, we can share our ideas best, and you can inspire future students with your work.</p>
<p>If you have highly confidential data and are unsure whether this option is the right one, see here for information on what to do in this case.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Public</strong>
</summary>
<p>You cannot select this option when creating your project, but for completeness, it is mentioned here.</p>
<p>With this option, the entire world could see your project because it can be accessed from outside the <strong>LIFOS</strong> site. This would leave the protected space of the exercise platform. Therefore, do not choose this option or only do so with careful consideration. For example, the project with the terms of use and the privacy policy is set to <strong>Public</strong> so that this information can be viewed before registration.</p>
</details>
<p>You can also add a project description. As a student in a group project, you cannot edit this yourself anymore. So make sure to choose a meaningful description right away. A subsequent change is only possible through the supervising person.</p>
<p>Finally, just click <em>Create Project</em> and you have created your first project.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_newprojectsite.png" /></p>
<p>Now it should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_ErstesProjekt.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="projekt---orientation" class="section level4">
<h4>Projekt - Orientation</h4>
<p>First and foremost, the README is the most important thing for you. Here you will find all the important information about the template. You can find it by simply scrolling down on your project page.
<img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_readMe.png" /></p>
<p>In addition, you will find various folders that are intended to provide you with guidance on what you will need, such as preregistration, scripts, etc. These are of course still in the standard format and not yet filled. You will need to fill them with files and modify them as necessary.</p>
<div id="upload-files" class="section level5">
<h5>Upload files</h5>
<p>Let’s start with an explanation of how to upload files to the repository. We assume that you have created or modified a file on your computer that you now want to add to your project. To upload it, go to the home page of your project on <strong>LIFOS</strong> and click on the plus button.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DateienHochladen.png" /></p>
<p>A list of options will appear. Let’s say we want to upload a file called “Dataanalysis.R”. We simply click on <em>Upload File</em>. Then you can easily insert the file using the drag-and-drop principle. You will also be prompted to write a commit message so that you will know later what you did or your group members can see what the new file is. This message should be short and informative and should include the name of the file you changed, such as “Add Dataanalysis.R to 2_Scripts”.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>What is a Commit?</strong>
</summary>
<p>As we have already described, LIFOS is a <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> instance. Uploading and modifying files in the <span style="color: darkred;">Git</span> universe is processed in a <code>commit</code>. <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> and <span style="color: darkred;">Git</span> manage versions of files, and each of these versions is stored within a <code>commit</code> in a repository - commits thus contain a copy of the version of each file.</p>
</details>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DateiCommit.png" />
Finally, click on <em>Upload File</em>. You will now find your file in the overview of your project:</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DatenauswertungÜbersicht.png" />
You can also create a new file directly on <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> by clicking on <em>New File</em>. Here you will also be prompted to write a commit message for the same reasons as above.</p>
<p>If you want to create a file directly in a folder, you must first open the desired folder and then repeat the same procedure as above.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DateiHochladenOrdner.png" /></p>
<p>We did not upload our file to a folder, but directly to the “homepage” of our project. In retrospect, we realize that the file should have been better placed in the “Scripts” folder. Normally, you would now move the file, but this is not possible on the browser version of <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span>. The only way to get the file into the folder is to delete it first and then upload it again. A more convenient option is provided by <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>. With <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, you can greatly simplify your work with <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span>. After you have finished reading this tutorial (recommended!), you can learn more about <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> <a href="#https://pandar.netlify.app/post/lifos/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you accidentally upload the same file twice, you will receive a warning message:</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_warningFileAlreadyExists.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="editing-files" class="section level5">
<h5>Editing files</h5>
<p>As you may have noticed, after initializing the project, a file has already been added to your project - the “README.md”. This is what you see when you scroll down to your project.</p>
<p>First of all, there is an overview of the project structure of the respective template, as well as a to-do list with the next steps for you. However, you can also write something about your project in the “README.md”, such as a summary or the goals of your project.</p>
<p>To edit the “README.md”, click on the file. Then a new window opens, where you click on <em>Open in WebIDE</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_readmeWebIDE.png" />
Now the Web IDE opens and you have the opportunity to edit the “README.md”. But as you can see, it’s not just a plain text file. The “README.md” is written in the Markdown language - that’s why it’s called “.md”. Don’t be intimidated by this! You can find a guide to Markdown in this tutorial a little further <a href="#basic-markdown-tutorial">down</a>, and you can also test your Markdown skills in an <a href="https://pandar.netlify.app/post/lifos-r-markdown-uebung/">exercise</a>.</p>
<p>However, the Web IDE cannot display all file formats. It works for .txt, .rmd, .R, or .md, but if you try to open a Word file or OpenOffice file, it won’t work.</p>
<p>You can view the previous version of your file under “History”.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_filehistory.png" /></p>
<p>Here you find all old versions of your file.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_fileSeeHistory.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="delete-files" class="section level5">
<h5>Delete files</h5>
<p>First of all you have to click on the file and you’ll see the <em>Delete</em>-Button.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DeleteFile.png" />
<span style="color: darkred;"><strong>GitLab</strong></span> then asks for a <em>Commit</em>-Message, this is important to keep everything documented for the future.</p>
<p>Now we can upload the files into the right folder.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_DateiScripts.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see “Datenauswertung.R” is now in the right folder.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="changing-folder-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Changing folder structure</h3>
<p>A lot of effort and feedback went into creating the templates so that you can find all the necessary folders in the project directly when selecting a template. At the same time, we cannot guarantee that it will fit perfectly in every case. Therefore, here is a brief description of how you can add or delete folders.</p>
<div id="create-a-folder" class="section level5">
<h5>Create a folder</h5>
<p>For demonstration purposes we’ll create a test folder. For this, we go to the homepage of our project and click on the “+” button:</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_OrdnerAdd.png" /></p>
<p>Then, a toggle-down list opens and we need to click on <em>New Directory</em>. Directory is the translation of the term folder that we know.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_OrdnerErstellen.png" /></p>
<p>Now you give this folder a name (e.g., “Test Folder”) and an appropriate commit message.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_OrdnerCommit.png" /></p>
<p>Then you have to click on <em>Create Directory</em>, and you have created a new folder! You can find it on the homepage of your project.</p>
</div>
<div id="delete-a-folder" class="section level5">
<h5>Delete a folder</h5>
<p>Sometimes a folder is unnecessary from the beginning, or it becomes clear over time that no information is stored there. For a tidy project, it would be useful to remove unnecessary folders from the structure. We will now demonstrate the procedure on our test folder. In <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span>, deleting works only if all files in the folder are deleted. Currently, only the “.gitkeep” file is in our folder. The “.gitkeep” file is an otherwise empty file that is simply there to keep otherwise empty folders or repositories alive. According to <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> logic, empty folders would otherwise be deleted immediately, and one would have to fill the folder with at least one file during initiation.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_OrdnerLöschen1.png" /></p>
<p>You open the folder (if you haven’t already done so) and click on this file. Then you just have to click on the <em>Delete</em> button.</p>
<p><img src="/post/gitlaborientierung_OrdnerLöschen2.png" /></p>
<p>After you have deleted the last file in your folder (in this case, “.gitkeep”), the folder will automatically disappear from your project.
<!-- Muss man gar nichts mehr drücken danach? Heißt die gitkeep Datei ist verantwortlich für den Erhalt des Ordners? Oder geht es auch bei jeder anderen Datei? Ja, genau. Das ist der ganze Zweck der .gitkeep Datei. Wenn man diese natürlich vor einer anderen Datei löscht, .gitkeep somit nicht die letzte Datei ist,  dann verschwindet der Ordner beim Löschen der letzten Datei, die in diesem Ordner existiert. Das habe ich aber nicht ausprobiert, aber nach GitLab-Logik funktioniert das so. --></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="delete-a-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Delete a project</h3>
<p>As we have already described in the intro to LIFOS, it is generally not possible for students to delete a project that belongs to a group. This is to prevent errors. If deletion is still necessary, please contact your supervisor or the <a href="mailto:lifos@uni-frankurt.de">central support of LIFOS</a>.</p>
<p>Instructions on how to delete your own projects (i.e., those without group affiliation) are described in the tutorial for the advanced Markdown exercise, which you can find <a href="https://pandar.netlify.app/post/lifos-r-markdown-uebung#löschen-eures-projektes">here</a>. However, a brief introduction to Markdown with descriptions of the most important functionalities is also provided here.</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-markdown-tutorial" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Markdown Tutorial</h2>
<p>In the context of LIFOS, Markdown is important because the README in your project is/will be written in it. Since the README presents your project, it is important that you can make it as appealing as possible. Markdown is a markup language that is relatively easy to use because of its simple syntax. A major advantage of Markdown is that you can write a simple text file that can then be converted into various document types (such as HTML, PDF, or even MS Word). Thus, people on different operating systems can easily collaborate on Markdown files. We will first show you the most important formatting options that could be relevant for your README.</p>
<div id="italics-and-bolds" class="section level5">
<h5>Italics and Bolds</h5>
<p>If you want to <strong>emphasize</strong> certain words, it is important to know how to use italics and bold. The tutorial will be structured so that first, the Markdown representation will always be shown, followed directly by the code for it.</p>
<p><em>italic</em>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>_italic_    </code></pre>
<p><strong>bold</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>**bold**    </code></pre>
<p><em>Both together</em> <strong>through several words</strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>_Both together_ **through several words**      </code></pre>
<p><strong><em>at the same time!</em></strong>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>**_at the same time!_**     </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="header" class="section level5">
<h5>HEADER</h5>
<p>Headers are very important for formatting your documents, as they allow you to define different levels within the file and draw attention to a particular section. There are six different headers that differ in size.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="this-is-a-type-1-header" class="section level1">
<h1>This is a Type 1 Header</h1>
<pre class="r"><code># This is a Type 1 Header    </code></pre>
<div id="type-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Type 2</h2>
<div id="type-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Type 3</h3>
<div id="type-4" class="section level4">
<h4>Type 4</h4>
<div id="type-5" class="section level5">
<h5>Type 5</h5>
<div id="type-6" class="section level6">
<h6>Type 6</h6>
<pre class="r"><code>## Type 2
### Type 3
#### Type 4
##### Type 5
###### Type 6   </code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the headers differ only in the number of # tags. It’s important to pay attention to the space between the # tags and your header, otherwise it won’t be formatted correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="links" class="section level4">
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>In this section, you will learn how to create links to another website or set your own anchors (linking to text in your document).</p>
<p><a name="anchor-point"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/users/sign_in">Visit the LIFOS-Server!</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>[Visit the LIFOS-Server!](https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/users/sign_in)       </code></pre>
<p>In the square brackets, you can write a short text describing where this link leads. Afterwards, in the round brackets, you can provide the actual link to the website.
Of course, all of this can also be integrated into the text if you want to mention a website like <a href="https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/users/sign_in">LIFOS</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>...a Website like [LIFOS](https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/users/sign_in) erwähnt.       </code></pre>
<p>Also interesting: You can also create reference links to other parts of your file. For example, you can refer to a specific section, such as your <a href="#introduction">first Caption</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>...such as your [first Caption](#introduction).       </code></pre>
<p>In the square brackets, you again specify what you are referring to, and in the round brackets, you provide the link to your heading. The heading is always written in lowercase and starts with a #-tag.</p>
<p>If your heading consists of multiple words, such as <a href="#italics--and--bolds">Italic and Bold</a>, then you need to link it as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>...such as [Italic and Bold](#italics--and--bolds)..       </code></pre>
<p>The words are all written in lowercase again, and there is always a “-” between the words, which replaces the space.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also set your own <a href="#anchor-point">anchors</a> by using the HTML tag “<a>” with a name attribute (e.g. “anchor-point”).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&lt;a name=&quot;anchor-point&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The text you want to link to is written under this expression. It can be located anywhere in the document. 

Now, here is the link text: 
...you can also set your own [anchors](#anchor-point). </code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is important to pay attention to the name attribute (here: anchor-point), especially to ensure that it is identical in both your link and the linked anchor. Otherwise, the link won’t work.</p>
</div>
<div id="pictures" class="section level4">
<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p>You can also insert images using Markdown. This works similar to links.</p>
<p>Here is an image of cute animals <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/10/01/09/21/pets-3715733_960_720.jpg" />.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>![](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/10/01/09/21/pets-3715733_960_720.jpg)       </code></pre>
<p>The difference to a link is that an exclamation mark “!” is added before the whole expression, followed by the image link. Be careful to only use copyright-free images.</p>
<p>If you want to link an internal image instead of an external one, you need the file path to that image in your repository.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>![](/path/to/image.jpg)     </code></pre>
<p>This image link should be relative to the location of your Markdown file (e.g. the ReadMe). Let’s say you uploaded the image in the folder “3_Data”. Then the image link would be as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>![](/3_Data/image.jpg)     </code></pre>
<p>If the image is located in a subfolder “subfolder”, the link would be as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>![](/3_Data/subordner/image.jpg)     </code></pre>
<p>Of course, you would replace “image.jpg” with your actual image file name.</p>
</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level4">
<h4>Lists</h4>
<p>There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thus</li>
<li>is</li>
<li>not</li>
<li>in order.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>* This
* is 
* not
* in order.       </code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This</li>
<li>is</li>
<li>in</li>
<li>order.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>1. This
2. is 
3. in
4. order.       </code></pre>
<p>If you want to create a more structured or complex list with indentations, you need to indent the list marker so that it aligns with the first letter of the word, one line above.</p>
<ul>
<li>but
<ul>
<li>not
<ul>
<li>too many indentations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>* but
  * not 
    * too many indentations.      </code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, it quickly becomes confusing.</p>
