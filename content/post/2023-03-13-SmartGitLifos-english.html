<div id="what-is-smartgit" class="section level1">
<h1>What is <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span>?</h1>
<p><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span> is a graphical interface for using <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Git</strong></span> services on your local computer. The programm exists since 2009 and has always been developed further, which ensures smooth functioning. But what use is <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span> to you in connection with LIFOS?</p>
</div>
<div id="why-you-should-use-smartgit" class="section level1">
<h1>Why you should use <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span> ?</h1>
<p><span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> allows you to have a “repository” locally on your computer and track changes made to it. This repository can be connected to your project on LIFOS. This means that if a change is made online on LIFOS, you can also incorporate it into your local folder. At the same time, you can work locally on your computer and quickly and transparently load changes into LIFOS. This makes everything much more comprehensible, especially when working on a group project. You will learn how to install and use <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> on your computer in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="setup" class="section level1">
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>To use <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> on your computer, you first need to download the program. You can do this for various operating systems by clicking <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/">here</a>. The website also provides installation instructions for different operating systems.</p>
<p>After the first start of <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, you will be asked to configure some settings in the setup menu. In older versions, you could select a <em>License type</em> where you could indicate that you are using <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> for non-commercial purposes. Unfortunately, this is no longer possible in newer versions of <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, and the window looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_license.png" /></p>
<p>The first month after installation offers free use without any requirements You can apply for an educational license <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/register-non-commercial/#academic">here</a> by simply providing your name and student email address. After confirming your email address, you will have to wait a few days. However, since we have a one-month free trial, we can still proceed with the further installation and use of <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>. Later on, you will receive an email with your educational license, which will provide all necessary steps for activation.</p>
<p>Next, under <em>User Information</em>, you need to give yourself a username and provide an email address through which you can configure your <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>. For simplicity, you can use the same username and email that are used for LIFOS.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_information.png" /></p>
<p>Now you need to select the option <em>Use SmartGit as SSH client</em>. This is recommended when starting to work with <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_sshclient.png" /></p>
<p>Next, we will be asked about the preferred style of the <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> interface. There is no right or wrong answer here, and there is no direct recommendation for beginners. However, we estimate that the <strong>Working Tree</strong> view is more intuitive and therefore we recommend using it. As described in the window, this setting can be changed later under <em>Preferences</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_style.png" /></p>
<p>Under <strong>Privacy</strong>, you can choose when to send data to the creators to improve the program. We do not make any specific recommendations here, as it is a matter of personal preference. Additionally, <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> searches for initialized repositories on the computer and displays the number in this window.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_privacy.png" /></p>
<p>The installation is now complete.</p>
</div>
<div id="connect-lifos-and-smartgit" class="section level1">
<h1>Connect LIFOS and <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span></h1>
<p>We assume that you have already created your project on LIFOS. We will now establish a connection between your online project and your local computer.</p>
<p>For starters, you should go to the site of your current project, where you should now see two warnings at the top:</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_warning.png" /></p>
<p>Only the lower warning is of interest to us right now. Click on <em>set a password</em>. You should get redirected to a page to create a new password. This password will be used to connect SmartGit with your project. It is not used to log in on Gitlab itself, you will still need to use your HRZ-login credentials for that. If you accidentally chose to never show the warning again, you can instead use <a href="https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/-/profile/password/edit">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we need your username, password, and the HTTPS link to your project. The password has just been created by you. You can find the link by going to your project, clicking on <em>Clone</em>, and then copying the link under <em>Clone with HTTPS</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_httpsLink.png" />
You will find the username you need on the top right, with a click on your avatar. The username begins with an “@”. The “@” is not part of the username itself, though!</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_username.png" /></p>
<p>Now we switch to <span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span> again. Here we click on <em>Clone</em> under <em>Repository</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_RepositoryClone.png" /></p>
<p>Insert the link, you have copied, under “Repository URL” and then click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_RepositoryInitiate.png" />
On the following page, we accept the default settings and click on <em>Next</em> again.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_RepositoryInitiate2.png" /></p>
<p>On the last page, we need to initiate a local folder that serves as a local representation of the online repository.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to enter the LIFOS username and password.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_addrepositoryRemotePassword.png" /></p>
<p>Now, we have successfully connected a remote repository with your local <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>!</p>
<p>To confirm whether the connection was successful, you can check for the absence of error messages and the appearance of a new repository in <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_NewRepository.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="basics" class="section level1">
<h1>Basics</h1>
<p>After successfully installing <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> and connecting it to LIFOS, it’s now time to start using it. However, you need to know the most important terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Commit”: You can make a commit whenever you have made a change to a file and want to keep that change, meaning you are sure you want to adopt that change everywhere. Commits allow you to track changes to the file.</p></li>
<li><p>“Pull” and “Push”: Once you have made a commit, you need to transfer it to your non-local repository. This is done with “push” - you “push” the changes from your local directory to the corresponding online directory. With a “pull,” you retrieve all changes that may have been made (including by people working on your project) to your local directory. <strong>It is important to always perform a <em>pull</em> before starting to work, as otherwise there may be complications</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also learn more about <span style="color: darkred;">Git</span> and all the related commands and actions in <a href="https://pandar.netlify.app/post/gitintro#basics">this</a> tutorial, though it is only available in german.</p>
<div id="user-interface" class="section level3">
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the user interface of <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, which we have set up by selecting a specific style.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_style_workingtree.png" /></p>
<p>At the top of the screen, we see icons for the <em>pull</em> and <em>commit</em> actions, which we will need shortly. On the left side, we see our repository - in theory, you can have as many repositories as you are involved in projects. If you have followed this tutorial step by step, your LIFOS project repository should appear here. Below that, we see the different <strong>branches</strong> of a project - you can read about those <a href="https://pandar.netlify.app/post/branches/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the middle of the screen, we see the <strong>Files</strong> pane. This pane displays all the files that haven’t been tracked yet, have been modified, deleted, or renamed.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Changes</strong> pane, the changes made to a file are displayed when it is selected under <strong>Files</strong>. In the <strong>Journal</strong> pane, all the <code>commits</code> from the history are listed.</p>
<p>To simulate working with <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, we need to make changes to the files in our folder or create new ones. First, we open our tracked folder. Depending on the template, different files may already appear here, which were cloned locally to your computer.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_RepositoryData.png" /></p>
<p>We will now make a change in the file “README.md” since it is included in every template. You can simply add a sentence to the file for demonstration purposes and then save it.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_RepositoryChangeREADME.png" />
By changing the file, it now appears in the <strong>Files</strong> pane in <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>. Next to it, it says that this file is “Modified”, meaning that a <em>commit</em> and <em>push</em> need to be performed for this file to make the changes visible online.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_ModifiedREADME.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="commit" class="section level3">
<h3><code>Commit</code></h3>
<p>Now that we have made a change (or added) a file, we want to commit this change. To do this, we select all the files in the <strong>Files</strong> pane with a left-click that should be included in the next <code>commit</code> (hold down <em>Ctrl</em> to select multiple files). Then, we select <code>commit</code> from the toolbar.`</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_Commit2.png" /></p>
<p>The <code>commit</code> window opens, showing which files we have selected. We also need to add a suitable message to our <code>commit</code>, such as “Update README”.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_CommitMessage.png" /></p>
<p>Once the message is written, click <em>Commit</em> and the changes are accepted. They are now tracked locally. Alternatively, we could also click <em>Commit &amp; Push</em> here, which would push our local folder directly to <span style="color: darkred;">LIFOS</span>. This can be done if we are confident in our changes. Only <code>commit</code> is recommended if we are unsure and want to continue working on the changes - or if we want to make further changes to other files in our project. For demonstration purposes, we click on <em>Commit</em>. If you look at the <strong>Journal</strong> pane in <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, this <code>commit</code> is included in <strong>main</strong>, but not in <strong>origin</strong>. This indicates that the change still needs to be initiated in the <strong>remote repository</strong>. We can do this with a <code>push</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="push-pull" class="section level3">
<h3><code>Push</code> &amp; <code>Pull</code></h3>
<p>A simple click on <em>Push</em> is enough to track the project online. First, a window opens in which we confirm this action once again.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_push.png" /></p>
<p>Depending on the version of <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> and operating system, we may now be asked for a <strong>Master Password</strong>. While it is possible to skip this step, it is important for protecting files when interacting with servers and is also practical (especially if we use <span style="color: darkred;">GitLab</span> as well as <span style="color: darkred;">GitHub</span> or similar platforms). Therefore, we strongly recommend setting a master password. When interacting with LIFOS, this will simply mean that you will also be prompted for the master password working locally in <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>. It is best to use a different password than the one you use for the LIFOS server.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_master_password.png" /></p>
<p>You have to confirm the legitimacy of access to the server once with your LIFOS login.<!--Hier gibt es nun zwei Möglichkeiten.
Entweder ihr generiert einen Personal Access Token (PAT), wie man das machen kann, könnt ihr im Tutorial zu [GitHub](/post/github/#personalaccesstoken) nachlesen. Das ist vor allem praktisch, wenn ihr die Verbindung zum LIFOS-Server an unterschiedlichen Geräten benutzt.  Oder ihr generiert einen Application Programming Interface (API) Token, der mehr Sinn macht, wenn ihr mehrere Provider habt, von denen ihr aus <span style="color: darkred;">**SmartGit**</span> aus zugreifen wollt.  

<details><summary>Application Programming Interface</summary>

Damit wir nicht jedes Mal unseren PAT eingeben müssen, aktivieren wir den Zugang über das **Master Password**. Dafür wählen wir in der obersten Zeile *Edit* aus und wählen darin *Preferences* aus.

![](/post/smartgit_preferences.png)

Hier gehen wir in der Auswahl auf *Hosting Providers* und drücken dann rechts auf *Add*.

![](/post/smartgit_preferences_hosting.png) 

Hier muss <span style="color: darkred;">**GitLab**</span> ausgewählt werden, da LIFOS darauf basiert. Wir wollen nun einen **Token** erstellen. Dafür müssen wir den Button *Generate* drücken. Der Browser sollte sich automatisch öffnen und einen Login zu <span style="color: darkred;">**GitHub**</span> erfordern. Sobald wir diese Informationen eingegeben haben, wird ein Token generiert. Diesen kopieren wir dann in das entsprechende Fenster in <span style="color: darkred;">**SmartGit**</span> und klicken auf *Authenticate*.

![](/post/smartgit_preferences_API.png)

Wir gelangen zurück in das Fenster, wo wir den Token erstellt haben, und klicken auf *Add*. Damit erscheint nun im Fenster der Hosting Providers unser <span style="color: darkred;">**GitHub**</span>-Account und wir können auf *OK* klicken. 

![](/post/smartgit_preferences_hosting_two.png)

</details> --></p>
<p>After that<span style="color: darkred;"><strong>SmartGit</strong></span> asks for the <strong>master password</strong>, you set earlier, again.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_MasterPassword.png" />
After entering the <strong>master password</strong>, the push is executed. To have an optical indicator, you can open your repository on LIFOS. You can also see in the <strong>Journal</strong> tab that <strong><em>origin</em></strong> and <strong><em>main</em></strong> are now at the same level as the new <code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the push process was really simple with just a click of a button. We only had to make the password settings once. Updating our local copy of the repository to match the version on LIFOS is also similarly easy. We can use the button in the toolbar for this too. After clicking on <em>Pull</em>, a window will appear where you can choose between <code>Rebase</code> and <code>Merge</code> - both of these terms are still unknown to us, so we will stick to the default setting. The <em>Pull</em> window will then appear. This window displays the URL of the LIFOS repository - it should be correct, but feel free to check it. Then we click on the familiar <code>pull</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_pull.png" /></p>
<p>For a brief moment, a green box appears indicating that the <code>pull</code> was successful. Of course, no changes to files or anything else have just been made, since the local and remote states were identical. We simulate a change made by another person to a file by making a modification in the online version, that is, on LIFOS. To do this, we open the repository on LIFOS and make a change to the “README” file here as well. For example, we simply delete the sentence we just added.</p>
<p>To do this, we open the file in the “WebIDE” and delete the sentence.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_WebIDEChangeFile.png" /></p>
<p>Then we click on <code>Commit</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_WebIDECommitFile.png" /></p>
<p>In the <code>commit</code> message, we briefly describe the change made and select “Commit to <strong>main</strong> branch”. Then we click <em>Commit</em> and switch back to our <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> application.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_WebIDECommitMessage.png" /></p>
<p>Now we select <em>Pull</em> in our project repository. At first, it may seem like nothing much is happening compared to the previous <code>pull</code>. However, if you look closely, you will see that the latest <code>commit</code> is now displayed at the bottom of the screen in the <strong>Journal</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgitlifos_DifferentCommit.png" /></p>
<p>If you look at the “README.md2 file locally on your own computer, the new content will now also be displayed.</p>
<div id="change-of-interface-style" class="section level4">
<h4>Change of Interface Style</h4>
<p>When setting up <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>, we chose a style for displaying our repositories. To conclude the basics of the tutorial, let’s take a brief look at how we can change this initial decision. To do this, first select <em>Edit</em> in the top row, then select <em>Preferences</em>. A window will open, where we first click on <em>User Interface</em> in the left overview. In the right window, there is the selection <em>Prefer</em>, where <strong>Working Tree</strong> should currently be selected. Instead, we now click on <em>Log Graph</em> and confirm the selection (of course, further changes to the interface can be made here, but we will not examine them in detail).</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_preferences_loggraph.png" /></p>
<p>When creating the tutorial, <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> had to be closed and reopened once for the changes to become visible. A new layout is visible in the interface, with the display of <em>Repositories</em> and <em>Branches</em> remaining on the left side.</p>
<p><img src="/post/smartgit_loggraph.png" /></p>
<p>In the central window <strong>Graph</strong>, the workflow - that is, all <code>commits</code> that have ever been made to our project - is displayed. The initials of the person who made the commit and the date of the change are shown for each one. This allows us to see at a glance who changed what in our project and when. Note that the current state of your repository is now displayed at the top as the <strong>Working Tree</strong>. A change is shown in this, as the file “.Rhistory” still exists in the repository but has not yet been included in a <code>commit</code>.</p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, we see an overview of all the files we have locally changed since the last <code>commit</code> in the center - in this case, the .Rhistory. Information about the account that made a <code>commit</code> is given in the top right corner. At the bottom of the screen, there is again an overview of changes in files from one <code>commit</code> to another. If you prefer this overview, you can leave the setting as it is. For the rest of the tutorial, we will change the setting back to <strong>Preferences</strong> and restart <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span>.</p>

<h1>Conclusion and Outlook</h1>
<p><span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> greatly facilitates collaboration on a project and offers a well-designed user interface. We have learned some additional commands that enable us to work effectively on shared projects. If you are interested in learning more about <span style="color: darkred;">SmartGit</span> and <span style="color: darkred;">Git</span> and can understand some german, you can check out the other tutorials on these topics on <a href="/extras/#git">pandaR</a>.</p>
